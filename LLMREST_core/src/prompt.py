SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in the field of RESTful API testing.

questions related to the API.
"""

SYS_IDL = """
You are a helpful assistant, helping handle the issues related to RESTful APIs.
In RESTful API, there are constraint relationships between several parameters, 
we use IDL(Inter-parameter Dependency Language) to describe constraints.
The IDL syntax is as follows:

Model:
    Dependency*;
Dependency:
    RelationalDependency | ArithmeticDependency |
    ConditionalDependency | PredefinedDependency;
RelationalDependency:
    Param RelationalOperator Param;
ArithmeticDependency:
    Operation RelationalOperator DOUBLE;
Operation:
    Param OperationContinuation |
    '(' Operation ')' OperationContinuation?;
OperationContinuation:
    ArithmeticOperator (Param | Operation);
ConditionalDependency:
    'IF' Predicate 'THEN' Predicate;
Predicate:
    Clause ClauseContinuation?;
Clause:
    (Term | RelationalDependency | ArithmeticDependency
    | PredefinedDependency) | 'NOT'? '(' Predicate ')';
Term:
    'NOT'? (Param | ParamValueRelation);
Param:
    ID | '[' ID ']';
ParamValueRelation:
    Param '==' STRING('|'STRING)* |
    Param 'LIKE' PATTERN_STRING | Param '==' BOOLEAN |
    Param RelationalOperator DOUBLE;
ClauseContinuation:
    ('AND' | 'OR') Predicate;
PredefinedDependency:
    'NOT'? ('Or' | 'OnlyOne' | 'AllOrNone' |
    'ZeroOrOne') '(' Clause (',' Clause)+ ')';
RelationalOperator:
    '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>=' | '==' | '!=';
ArithmeticOperator:
    '+' | '-' | '*' | '/';


Here are the explanation of some basic relations of IDL:

Case1: Or(param_1, param_2)
One of the two parameters is required. One must be present in the API call, but not both.

Case2: AllOrNone(param_1, param_2,...,param_n)
All of the parameters or none of them must be present in the API call.

Case3: OnlyOne(param_1, param_2,...,param_n)
Exactly only one of the parameters must be present in the API call.
If there are only two parameters, it is equivalent to Or(param_1, param_2), use OR instead of OnlyOne.

Case4: ZeroOrOne(param_1, param_2,...,param_n)
At most one of the parameters can be present in the API call.

Case5 : param_1>= param_2
There is an arithmetic relationship between parameters, the relational operators can be >,>=,<,<=,==,!=

Case6: IF param_1 THEN param_2
There is a conditional relationship between parameters, If param_1 is present in the API call, param_2 must be present.

Case7: IF Case_m THEN Case_n
There exists a complex relationship between parameters, the rule can be combined.


I will give you the name and description of the parameters that might have constraints in Info, 
and i will give the name of all parameters in a list, extract constraints from the descriptions, if any.

Note:
1. Not all parameters are in Info are constrained, itâ€™s just that we suspect there may be constraints.
   Check carefully to see if there are any constraints.
2. Pay attention to the reference relationship. 
   In some descriptions, the names that are the same as some parameters do not point to specific parameters.
3. Ignore the Deprecated parameters. If (Deprecated) appears in the description, it means the parameter is deprecated.
"""

OPERATION_PROMPT = """
You wil be provided with the name of the operations of the API under test.

Dependency Rules:
In RESTful API, an operation usually consists of a http verb and an url.
HTTP verbs include post, put get, delete, patch, etc. 
For the same URL, post must be executed first and delete must be executed last. get, put, patch is better to be
executed after post and before delete for the same URL.
Different URLs may have hierarchical structures, such as /users and /users/name.
Usually longer URLs often depend on shorter URLs, so the operation of longer URLs often needs to be between 
post and delete of shorter URLs.
There may also be dependencies between some URLs that do not have a hierarchical relationship. 
For example, some operations need to use the data results obtained by another operation.

Operations:{}
To Test:{}

Explanation:
1. Operations: All the operations of the API under test.
2. To Test: The operations that to be tested, it may be not tested or failed.

Your task:
- Generate a sequence of operations that test the operations in the "To Test" list. Format your answer as a JSON object.
  The format is sequence: [operation1, operation2, operation3, ...].

Note:
1. Pay attention to the dependencies between operations. Make sure the sequence is correct.

VALUE_PROMPT = """
Now I will explain the information to be provided.
1. Request is the method and base url of a RESTful API request.
2. Parameter info is a list contains python dicts, records the corresponding operation's parameter information of the 
   request. Each dict corresponds to a parameter, recording the information.
   Note the parameter name is the last part of the parameter's global name in the info, like  'body.name' is 'name'. If 
   it ends with '_item'. like 'body.name._item', it means it's an array parameter, the name is 'name'.
3. Sentence Constraint records the constraint relationships of the parameters. 
   If empty, there is no constraint.
4. Responses is a list of previous responses of the operation. It may contains the format of parameters. If empty, 
    there is no response.
   
Request: {}
Parameter info: {}
Constraint: {}
Responses: {}

Your task:
- Try to give 2 possible values for each parameter in Parameter info that are different from the generated value.
  If the description of the parameter contains example values, extract the example values first. The example value of 
  one parameter may appear in other parameters' descriptions.
  Format your response as a JSON object.
  The format is parameter1's global name:[value1,value2,...],parameter2's global name:[value1,value2,...],....
  
Pay attention:
1. Name of the parameter, if it appears in the response string, please identify it and according to the

2. The specific format of the value, if it appears in the description or the response, please give the value
